# Site Network Plan

Customer: Acme Distribution  
Location: Regional Distribution Center – Denver, CO  
Site ID: SITE-2847  

---

## VLAN Design

| VLAN ID | Name        | Subnet         | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------------|----------|
| 1        | Management | 10.50.1.0/24  | IT management, SSH access, edge device management |
| 10       | Corporate  | 10.50.10.0/24 | Office workstations and internal business systems |
| 20       | Cameras    | 10.50.20.0/24 | IP cameras (isolated surveillance network) |

---

## IP Addressing Scheme

- Site Subnet: 10.50.0.0/16
- Management Gateway: 10.50.1.1
- Corporate Gateway: 10.50.10.1
- Camera Gateway: 10.50.20.1
- DNS Servers: 10.50.1.10, 10.50.1.11
- NTP Server: 10.50.1.10
- Cameras use DHCP within Camera VLAN
- Edge device uses static IP in Management VLAN

---

## Camera Network Isolation

- All cameras are placed in VLAN 20 (10.50.20.0/24).
- No direct access from Corporate VLAN to Camera VLAN.
- Inter-VLAN routing restricted via firewall.
- Only edge device allowed to access camera streams.
- All outbound cloud traffic goes through IPsec VPN tunnel to AWS VPC.
- No direct internet exposure for cameras.

---

## Edge Device Network Configuration

Hardware: Dell PowerEdge XR4000  
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  

NIC Configuration:
- eno1 → Management VLAN (10.50.1.0/24) + WAN uplink
- eno2 → Camera VLAN (10.50.20.0/24)

Security:
- SSH access restricted to Management VLAN
- Firewall rules allow camera traffic (RTSP/ONVIF) only from VLAN 20 to edge device
- Cloud communication restricted to VPN endpoint

---

## Traffic Flow

1. Cameras send RTSP/ONVIF streams to edge device (VLAN 20).
2. Edge device processes video locally.
3. Metadata and monitoring metrics sent to cloud over IPsec VPN.
4. Corporate users access systems only via Corporate VLAN.
5. All cloud traffic flows through dedicated 100 Mbps fiber connection.

---

## Security Considerations

- Camera VLAN fully isolated.
- Edge device hardened and monitored.
- VPN encryption for all cloud traffic.
- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring on edge.
- Remote management enabled through secure management VLAN only.
